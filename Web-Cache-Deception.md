## Web Cache Deception

* Always use Cache-Control headers to mark dynamic resources, set with the directives no-store and private.
* Configure your CDN settings so that your caching rules don't override the Cache-Control header.
* Activate any protection that your CDN has against web cache deception attacks. Many CDNs enable you to set a cache rule that verifies that the response Content-Type matches the request's URL file extension. For example, Cloudflare's Cache Deception Armor.
* Verify that there aren't any discrepancies between how the origin server and the cache interpret URL paths.
